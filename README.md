Transcriptom Analysis

Welcome to follow our pipeline. This is all the script and corresponding demo data in the transcriptome analysis.  Feel free to download and run it. XD

Each rar file contains code and sample data, as well as sample results for reference.

Of course, you can also download or view all the code directly in the script folder.

All the code can run on CentOS 7.8, Debian 10 and Window10. If you have any questions about the environment configuration, please contact me. XD
